<h1 id="nosgoth-and-roto-mar">Nosgoth and Roto-Mar</h1>
<p>The people in Nosgoth are friendly! They know Jacqueline there. You can tell they really know her because when she is confused about things they're happy about it the way friends are happy about friends being themselves.</p>
<p>The person in charge in Nosgoth is called Kaine, and he really likes TV. I am not sure what TV is but I know he likes it a lot. He is friendly and chatty and I liked talking to him. And he knew how to fix Jacqueline's elbow hole! Vampires have to drink rainbow blood, which is made out of people. If you stop putting rainbow blood into a vampire they get holes in them and the rainbow blood starts coming back out. So now Jacqueline has an elbow again.</p>
<p>I got lost again in Nosgoth. I think I might have fallen asleep? I remember us arriving but I don't really remember us leaving, and I must have been with us when we left and went to Roto-Mar, because I was in Roto-Mar when the rest of us were, but nobody's quite sure how I got there.</p>
<p>The people in Roto-Mar were nice to me and gave me candy, which Clarence says is because they wanted to trap me and vivisect me, but they still gave me candy and I'm happy about that part. I like sugar skulls. They go crunch in a neat way.</p>
<p>After my friends rescued me from the people with candy, they were trying to tell me something and couldn't, so we decided I should be Ooziels with Otto again. Otto's memories are still confusing but it was easier the second time around. The things they couldn't tell me were about the person they stole a Chaos Emerald from in Roto-Mar and how she wants to kill everyone so that she can escape the universe. I'm not sure I understood it very well.</p>
