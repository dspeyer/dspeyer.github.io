<h1 class="western">The Crystal of the Floating Isle</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Many have claimed
that it was the retrieval, sometime called the Theft, of the Warp
Crystal from the Floating Isle which triggered the Incursion.  Fewer
have claimed to have substantive knowledge of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As for the Isle
itself, it appears on many pre-Incursion maps, but rarely in the same
place<sup>32-35</sup>.  It is said to have maintained an altitude of
one thousand to five thousand feet, so perhaps it was blown about by
the wind.  Most maps describe it as roughly circular, three miles in
diameter, with a pair of rivers emerging from a central spring and
pouring off opposite sides, dividing the Isle in two.  Whether the
water then fell to Earth as a torrent is unclear.  Perhaps it spread
in the air and turned to mist.  Some waterfalls have been observed to
do that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Most geologists
believe the Anabaric Andesite Flats are what remain of the Isle<sup>36,37</sup>.
 The shape is reasonable; there is no other explanation for so much
andesite so far from a volcano, and the rock layers beneath show
signs of impact trauma.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As for the theft,
even less is known.  One councilwoman who commissioned the operation
commented shortly afterwards:</p>

<i>We knew Sig Mar had sent at least one vampire to retrieve the
thing, so we hired the only exalted mercenaries we could find.  Both
were Tzeentchians.  We weren't happy about that, but what else could
we do?  We hoped the two of them would keep an eye on each other. 
Even in hindsight, I'm not sure there was a better way.  We couldn't
let the lich get something like that, could we?<sup>38</sup></i></p>

The identity of the vampire has not been determined, but the vampire
historian Negletee quotes him as saying “Tigers here don't have
stripes.  Just one side black; one side orange.  Huh.”<sup>3</sup><sup>9</sup>
Negletee fails to cite his source, or even explain how this text
fragment survives, but instead speculates on how this is a sign that
even then the Crystal was fundamentally a force of Order rather than
Chaos.</p>

There also exists a lengthy description of the gem's demiplane in the
pre-incursion <i>physics</i> textbook Introduction to Planar
Manipulation Using Tensor Calculus and Lie Groups, Seventh Edition. 
It is credited to “a witness”:</p>

<i>Where the gem should have been there was a glowing golden ring,
nearly two meters in diameter.  It rotated slowly about its vertical
axis and shot a firehose of water straight up.  When we passed
through the ring, we found a room nearly a hundred meters across,
completely packed with warp demons.  I don't know how many angels can
dance on the head of a pin, but a terrifyingly large crowd of demons
can dance in a demiplane that doesn't technically consume space. 
They were all dancing disco.  It seemed to be the only thing they
cared about.  They may have literally been incarnations of the desire
to disco.</i></p>

<i>The gem floated above the dance floor.  A series of pipes poured a
constant stream of water on it.  Where they got the water wasn't
clear.  Once the water interacted with the gem, it shot straight up
in the air and then faded as it crossed the demiplane boundary.  I
think being constantly immersed in water dampened the gem's
effects.<sup>40</sup></i></p>

There is one more text that may bear on the subject, albeit at a
remove.  This from the organizer of a magic conference shortly after
fifth-level spells began to fail:</p>

<i>He was an Alteran, so I figured that had to be worth something. 
But his understanding of magical theory was weak at  best.  He tried
to impress me with the Goo Conjuration spell he'd invented.  Told me
about a time when he'd specified “Grows when frozen” and “Freezes
a little below room temperature” as properties, and used that to
pry open rock.  Which seemed clever, if not particularly relevant. 
Then I asked him when and where he'd done it and he got real quiet.</i></p>

As evidence of the speaker's identity, this is hardly conclusive. 
And even if that was indeed the case, his own honesty is far from
established.  Still, with the paucity of surviving sources, it is
necessary to include it.</p>

If we accept this account as genuine, we must conclude the ring was
underground, and protected by a considerable quantity of solid rock. 
That it was buried in rock may account for how it cause the Isle to
float in the first place, but this is far from clear.</p>

Particularly lacking in these limited surviving accounts is any
description of the Crystal's <i>color</i>.  Without that, we cannot
say for certain that it was the same Crystal that was delivered to
Patient Zero.</p>

The argument that it was rests mainly on the timing, with the Theft
occurring less than two weeks before the delivery.  Even this
argument is dependent upon somewhat controversial claims regarding
the pre-Incursion calendar....</p>
