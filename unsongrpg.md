# Philosophy

This game assumes you have read [Unsong](https://unsongbook.com) and remember it well.  If you have not, you will likely be very confused.

A successful game *should* include lots of specifically worked out placebomancy and yetzirah manipulation.  That's what makes the setting vibrant, and will make for great stories afterwards.  Therefore these things never get shoved under the abstraction threshold.  But it should be possible to play a character who is better at these things than you are.  Hence the entire-table-helps mechanics.

Meanwhile, a lot of more boring things *are* getting shoved under the abstraction threshold.  There are explicit rules for retconning equipment precisely so that you don't have to worry about it in advance.

The rules are not designed to stand up to minmaxing or munchkinry.  If you are inclined toward those, know that you will find no interesting challenge here and move on.

## Spoiler Warning

These mechanics reveal things from Unsong which would otherwise be surprises, including one major piece of the ending.

# Basic Mechanics

To see if you succeed at something, roll a number of d10s equal to your relevant ability and add the results.  If any die rolls a 10 (“explodes”) reroll it and keep both values.  If you have a specific skill that is directly relevant, add two dice.  Somewhat relevant, one die.  If this leaves you with no dice to roll, roll a d4 (it does not explode).  Add a (non-exploding) d4 if circumstances are conducive to your success.

If the total value on the dice meets or exceeds the DC, you succeed.

(Do not use any dice besides d10s and d4s.  Unless you have physical d22s or d72s, in which case you should find a way to incorporate them.

If an action targets a character (and the target is aware) said target may assist or resist as a reaction.  They roll a relevant ability and add or subtract half their result from the actor's.

In general, DCs should look like:

* 2: Trivial; why are you even rolling?
* 5: A sign of basic competence
* 10: If this is your thing, you should be able to do this
* 15: Requires real effort from specialists
* 20: Seriously impressive
* 30: Near the best of real-world achievement
* 40: Superhuman

## Combat

If it is necessary to keep track of exactly when characters do things, go into rounds.  Use 10 rounds to the minute.  During a round, you can move up to 20 cubits and do something.

To determine order within a round, roll initiative using Violence.  Ties are broken in favor of the player sitting closer tot he DM's right (NPCs last).  In an ambush or similar scenario, there is one surprise round in which only the ambushers act, followed by initiative as normal.

There are no hit points.  Injuries are described in-universe.  Being shot with a gun is usually fatal.

If your character is about to die or otherwise suffer unacceptable harm, you may permanently burn a Destiny die to prevent it by implausible coincidence.  If you have no Destiny dice, you cannot do this.


## Character Generation

You start with 10 points to distribute among the abilities.  You may not put more than 4 dice in any one ability.  (A campaign that starts with experienced characters might start with more dice.  The limit on any ability remains 40%, rounded down.)

While not strictly mandatory, it is advisable to put at least one point into Destiny, Social Skills, Metis and Wealth.  A character with no Destiny ultimately doesn't matter, and cannot use the retroactive resource rules.  One with no Social Skills has no relationships, and requires an explanation of how they wound up in an adventuring party.  A character with no Metis cannot reliably prepare meals or outfits for themselves, and requires an active full-time caretaker.  And a character with no wealth has only a 3/4 chance to own pants.

You may claim unlimited resources if you could get them by rolling all 3s on your relevant acquisition check.  Please keep this within reason for a character concept.  Granted, “crazy hoarder” *is* a character concept.  Also, remember that you can fill these in retroactively (see the Resources section).

You also start with four “expensive” resources, which you could get by rolling all 5s on your check.  You may leave some of these blank to fill in retroactively if you wish.  Mark these by checking the “SX” (Starting Expensive) box on your character sheet.

(There are blanks on your character sheet to mark these DCs.  They are useful if you are likely to gain abilities during the game, but may not have immediate downtime.)

Note that languages spoken beyond your native ones count as resources.  You may have multiple native languages if it fits your backstory.  Do not abuse this.

You may be an ordained priest, which enables you to create Holy Water and grants social bonuses in relevant situations.  This counts as a connection and as an expensive resource regardless of your abilities.

A [blank character sheet](unsong_charsheet.html) is available.

### Extra Special Abilities

There are people in this setting with extra abilities that don't fit neatly.  Starting with these means starting with fewer ability dice, and should effect your roleplay substantially.

For example, you can be a Fallen Angel.  This has advantages: you are fluent in all languages except Aramaic; can fly when drunk on holy water; can conjure a flaming sword at will; and if killed by ordinary violence, you recorporate after a brief time.  It also has disadvantages: you cannot learn Aramaic, comprehend deception, reliably remember limitations, or generally cope with the harshness of the world.  You start with one fewer ability die.

You can also have a complicated relationship with space.  Using this to your advantage requires a dc 10 Metaphors check.  You start with two fewer ability dice.

Other abilities are possible, at similar ability-die costs.

## Leveling

In a multi-session campaign, characters gain dice of abilities after successful sessions: one for a basic session, two for a session with significant challenge or accomplishment, and four for resolving a major plot point.  If multiple dice are gained in a session, they must be placed in separate abilities.  Also, no ability can hold more than 40% of your total dice.

This does not grant resources, or change the DCs at which retroactive resources can be obtained.  (See [Resources](#resources))

If there is in-universe downtime, characters may acquire resources.  This may either be done explicitly, with estimates of how long the acquisitions take, or abstractly, with one Starting Expensive Resource slot per week.  Having downtime, even just one week of it, *does* update the DCs at which retroactive resources can be obtained.

# Abilities

The abilities (and some example DCs, to be adjusted on the fly by the DM) are:

## Destiny

How relevant your success is to Adam Kadmon's ultimate goodness. A high destiny check means the setting's contrived co-incidences go your way.

Destiny powers the retroactive resource rules (see: [Resources](#resources)) and can be burned to avoid death (see: [Combat](#combat)).  It also controls circumstances that intuitively qualify as "luck".  Furthermore, a player may call for a convenient coincidence a number of times per session equal to their destiny dice, and then roll to see just how convenient the coincidence is.

Example DCs:

* 5: Something which by actual luck had about a 50% chance of happening
* 10: Something which by actual luck had about a 25% chance of happening

## Metaphors

Recognizing how things are metaphors for eachother. Interacting with Yitzerah.

Example DCs:

* 10: Identify what aspects of the current situation apply to the Vanishing Name
* 20: Exchange words telepathically
* 25: Deeper telepathy
* 25: Obtain crypric prophessies
* 30: Letter manipulation when already in Yitzerah
* 35: Deliberately step in or out of Yitzerah
* 40: Teleportation
* 40: See clearly into the future during a solar eclipse
* 50: Letter manipulation in the material world

## Exegesis

Knowledge and comprehension of the world as it functions via sephirot.  Knowledge of the sephirot themselves, of sacred texts, and of languages.  Finding relevant references in Tanakh or Talmud. Finding linguistic correspondences.

Does not include how the world functions via math: that's Science.  Also does not include practical skills: those are Metis.

Example DCs:

* 5: Identify how interactions among sephirot correspond to lived experiences
* 10: Find the most relevant bit of Torah to a particular situation
* 15: Identify how a randomly chosen text applies to a given situation
* 15: Determine whether a linguistic correspondence is the work of mundane language evolution or reveals a hidden truth of Adam Kadmon
* 20: Trace a consonant triple through a dozen unrelated languages
* 30: Find all references to a concept in a large body of text

## Social Skills

Self explanatory.

Example DCs:

* 10: To befriend a stranger
* 15: To convince someone of something plausible (if false, subtract half their roll; if true, add half)
* 20: To make peace where there is strife

## Violence

Everything from wrestling to sniping.

Example DCs:

* 10: Shoot someone with a long-barreled gun at close range
* 15: Shoot someone with a pistol at close range or long gun at moderate range
* 15: Use rapier and dagger effectively
* 25: Use a sniper rifle at multi-mile range

## Naming

Learn and reason about Names.

Example DCs:

* 5: Look up and memorize a Name which is explicitely available to the public
* 10-15: Track down a Name which is known to the Unitarians or other underground group
* 20: Deduce how a Name will operate with regard to edge-cases
* 20: Speak a Name at double speed
* 20: Memorize a Name by staring at it on a piece of paper for six seconds
* 25: Deduce a name from most of it, using principles of names
* 25: Crack early klipot
* 25: Memorize a Name by hearing it once.
* 25: Improvise a simple but novel klipah on the spot
* 30: Improve state-of-the-art Name-finding algorithms efficiency by 1%
* 30: Spake a Name at triple speed
* 35: Crack state-of-the-art klipot
* 35: Speak a Name at double speed in an improvised klipah

## Placebomancy

Perform placebomancy, or deduce how effective it will be without performing it.

Example DCs:

* 10: Grant a simple blessing, allowing the recipient to reroll one die in the course of their next operation
* 15: Grant a more substantive blessing, such as +1 die to all checks of one ability thoughout the operation, or automatic successes on a more narrow category of checks.
* 20: Achieve ends which would be highly impractical naturally, using a comparable degree of effort
* 20: Deduce the effectiveness of a ritual without performing it
* 25: Make up for not-quite-heroic preparation with style
* 30: (As a player) the entire table (including DM) helps you brainstorm

## Science

The world as based on physics. Includes knowing which bits of physics are running at the moment.  Also includes practical applications via technology.

Example DCs:

* 15: Repair most technological devices
* 20: (As a player) use the internet and then treat it as character knowledge
* 25: Break security (digital or physical) on a government office

## Metis

Practical skills. Includes anything that doesn't fit anywhere in particular.

Example DCs:

* 10: Hold down a job

## Wealth

Your ability to buy things unexpectedly.  This is approximately the amount of money you have, but after earmarking some of it for rent, adding easily accessible credit, etc.

Example DCs:

* 2: Anything that IRL would be <$100
* 5: <$300
* 10: <$1000
* 15: <$3000
* etc.

# Resources

Resources are things your character has that are less fundamental than abilities.  They come in four types: physical possessions, specific skills, names, and connections.

Learning a new skill is usually either a Metis or Science check, and tends to take quite a while.  When making a check for which a specific skill is relevant, add two dice.  Example learning DCs:

* Metis 5: Jerry-rig a belay system out of rope; compose sonnets; cook arbitrary Thai curries
* Metis 10: Work as a secretary for a large business; craft or repair clothing so that it looks “real”
* Science 5: Identify edible plants in your native environment; Change oil in a car
* Science 10: Write ordinary software; Understand organic chemistry
* Understanding 5: Know some basic vocabulary in a foreign language, enough to express simple concepts most of the time
* Understanding 7: Speak fluently a language which is related to your native language or which is noted for simple grammar and phonemics
* Understanding 10: Speak an ordinary foreign language fluently
* Understanding 15: Speak fluently a foreign language that is notoriously difficult to learn, such as Arabic, Cantonese or Xhosa

Making connections is a Social Skills check.  Again, this takes a while, and it is usually better to role-play explicitly outside of backstory.  For backstory purposes, some example DCs:

* 5: Have a casual friend who works in the health care industry
* 10: Have a casual friend at a specific hospital
* 20: Be trusted by a notorious crime boss

Resources can be claimed retroactively, up to the limits of chargen.  A resource that is clearly in line with a character concept is automatic.  One which isn't requires a Destiny check, with bonus dice for being somewhat in line.  Once a resource is claimed retroactively, you have it permanently (unless you lose it in-universe).

When claiming retroactive resources, use your ability scores at time of last downtime, not your current ones (if they differ).

## Speaking Names

You can speak any name which you know.  Ordinary people can speak 10 syllables a round (speaking slowly and carefully) but with a sufficient Naming check, you can speak at twice that speed.  Speaking in a klipah requires and additional Naming check (dc 15 for a simple one, higher for more complicated) unless you've specifically practiced that particular klipah.

If the name allows choices (e.g. the Kinetic name), controlling it with precision also requires a Naming check.

Writing a name does not activate it, but does trigger any Sentinal Names in the vicinity.  Triggering a written name is easy, and destroys the name.  (Destroying the name does not automatically trigger it – if you want a chain reaction of Wrathful names, you need to engineer that deliberately.)

Only a human can write or speak a name.

## Researching Names

Some names can be discovered by diligent effort in libraries and Unitarian forums.

A DC 2 Naming check can find the Mortal Name.

A DC 5 Naming check can find any of the Ascending, Chromatic, Coagulant, Extinguishing, Luminous, or Sobering Names.

A DC 10 Naming check can find any of the Avalanche, Bulletproof, Fulminent, Kindling, Kinetic, Respiratory, Steelforging, Taming, Tenebrous, Thunderclap or Wakening Names.

A DC 15 Naming check can find any of the Abjuring, Cavernous, Enlivening, Liberating, Magnifying, Reconditioning, Sentinel, Taming, Vanishing or Volatile Names.

More obscure names generally require quests.

The Coagulant, Extinguishing, Luminous, and Thunderclap Names are available in scrollwheel form as a DC 5 Wealth check.
