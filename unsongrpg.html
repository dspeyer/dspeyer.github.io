<h1 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h1>
<p>This game assumes you have read <a href="https://unsongbook.com">Unsong</a> and remember it well. If you have not, you will likely be very confused.</p>
<p>A successful game <em>should</em> include lots of specifically worked out placebomancy and yetzirah manipulation. That's what makes the setting vibrant, and will make for great stories afterwards. Therefore these things never get shoved under the abstraction threshold. But it should be possible to play a character who is better at these things than you are. Hence the entire-table-helps mechanics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a lot of more boring things <em>are</em> getting shoved under the abstraction threshold. There are explicit rules for retconning equipment precisely so that you don't have to worry about it in advance.</p>
<p>The rules are not designed to stand up to minmaxing or munchkinry. If you are inclined toward those, know that you will find no interesting challenge here and move on.</p>
<h2 id="spoiler-warning">Spoiler Warning</h2>
<p>These mechanics reveal things from Unsong which would otherwise be surprises, including one major piece of the ending.</p>
<h2 id="powerful-characters">Powerful Characters</h2>
<p>A long campaign (or high level one-shot) may see player characters rivaling the cometspawn in power. If the PCs become too powerful to coexist with the canon plot, simply declare that the game is taking place in an adjacent world in The Garden. Whether or not you do this, there's no reason canon characters can't appear as visiting NPCs, at least provided your players are good at keeping player and character knowledge separate.</p>
<p>That said, there are no rules here for Theoretical Kabbalah (that only Uriel can cope with) nor the Celestial Kabbalah (that exactly four mortals have touched). We deal only in the Applied and Worldly Kabbalah, which are somewhat more broadly used.</p>
<h1 id="basic-mechanics">Basic Mechanics</h1>
<p>To see if you succeed at something, roll a number of d10s equal to your relevant ability and add the results. If any die rolls a 10 (“explodes”) reroll it and keep both values. If you have a specific skill that is directly relevant, add two dice. Somewhat relevant, one die. If this leaves you with no dice to roll, roll a d4 (it does not explode). Add a (non-exploding) d4 if circumstances are conducive to your success.</p>
<p>If the total value on the dice meets or exceeds the DC, you succeed.</p>
<p>(Do not use any dice besides d10s and d4s. Unless you have physical d22s or d72s, in which case you should find a way to incorporate them.</p>
<p>If an action targets a character (and the target is aware) said target may assist or resist as a reaction. They roll a relevant ability and add or subtract half their result from the actor's.</p>
<p>In general, DCs should look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>2: Trivial; why are you even rolling?</li>
<li>5: A sign of basic competence</li>
<li>10: If this is your thing, you should be able to do this</li>
<li>15: Requires real effort from specialists</li>
<li>20: Seriously impressive</li>
<li>30: Near the best of real-world achievement</li>
<li>40: Superhuman</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>If it is necessary to keep track of exactly when characters do things, go into rounds. Use 10 rounds to the minute. During a round, you can move up to 20 cubits and do something.</p>
<p>To determine order within a round, roll initiative using Violence. Ties are broken in favor of the player sitting closer to the DM's right (NPCs last). In an ambush or similar scenario, there is one surprise round in which only the ambushers act, followed by initiative as normal.</p>
<p>There are no hit points. Injuries are described in-universe. Being shot with a gun is usually fatal.</p>
<p>If your character is about to die or otherwise suffer unacceptable harm, you may permanently burn a Destiny die to prevent it by implausible coincidence. If you have no Destiny dice, you cannot do this.</p>
<h2 id="character-generation">Character Generation</h2>
<p>You start with 10 dice to distribute among the abilities. You may not put more than 4 dice in any one ability. (A campaign that starts with experienced characters might start with more dice. The limit on any ability remains 40%, rounded down.)</p>
<p>While not strictly mandatory, it is advisable to put at least one die into each of Destiny, Social Skills, Metis and Wealth. A character with no Destiny ultimately doesn't matter, and cannot use the retroactive resource rules. One with no Social Skills has no relationships, and requires an explanation of how they wound up in an adventuring party. A character with no Metis cannot reliably prepare meals or outfits for themselves, and requires an active full-time caretaker. And a character with no wealth has only a 3/4 chance to own pants.</p>
<p>You may claim unlimited resources if you could get them by rolling all 3s on your relevant acquisition check. Please keep this within reason for a character concept. Granted, “crazy hoarder” <em>is</em> a character concept. Also, remember that you can fill these in retroactively (see the <a href="#resources">Resources</a> section).</p>
<p>You also start with four “expensive” resources, which you could get by rolling all 5s on your check. You may leave some of these blank to fill in retroactively if you wish. Mark these by checking the “SX” (Starting Expensive) box on your character sheet.</p>
<p>(There are blanks on your character sheet to mark these DCs. They are useful if you are likely to gain abilities during the game, but may not have immediate downtime.)</p>
<p>Note that languages spoken beyond your native ones count as resources. You may have multiple native languages if it fits your backstory. Do not abuse this.</p>
<p>You may be an ordained priest, which enables you to create Holy Water and grants social bonuses in relevant situations. This counts as a connection and as an expensive resource regardless of your abilities.</p>
<p>A <a href="unsong_charsheet.html">blank character sheet</a> is available.</p>
<h3 id="extra-special-abilities">Extra Special Abilities</h3>
<p>There are people in this setting with extra abilities that don't fit neatly. Starting with these means starting with fewer ability dice, and should effect your roleplay substantially.</p>
<p>For example, you can be a Fallen Angel. This has advantages: you are fluent in all languages except Aramaic; can fly when drunk on holy water; can conjure a flaming sword at will; and if killed by ordinary violence, you recorporate after a brief time. It also has disadvantages: you cannot learn Aramaic, comprehend deception, reliably remember limitations, or generally cope with the harshness of the world. You start with two fewer ability dice.</p>
<p>You can also have a complicated relationship with space. Using this to your advantage requires a dc 10 Metaphors check. You start with four fewer ability dice.</p>
<p>Other abilities are possible, at similar ability-die costs.</p>
<h2 id="leveling">Leveling</h2>
<p>In a multi-session campaign, characters gain dice after successful sessions: one for a basic session, two for a session with significant challenge or accomplishment, and four for resolving a major plot point. If multiple dice are gained in a session, they must be placed in separate abilities. Also, no ability can hold more than four tenthes of your total dice. This means that the maximum dice in any attribute increases at total dice 13, 15, 18 and 20. (It is recommended that campaigns wrap by die 22, as characters are probably getting too powerful at that point.)</p>
<p>This does not grant resources, or change the DCs at which retroactive resources can be obtained. (See <a href="#resources">Resources</a>)</p>
<p>If there is in-universe downtime, characters may acquire resources. This may either be done explicitly, with estimates of how long the acquisitions take, or abstractly, with one Starting Expensive Resource slot per week. Having downtime, even just one week of it, <em>does</em> update the DCs at which retroactive resources can be obtained.</p>
<h1 id="abilities">Abilities</h1>
<p>The abilities (and some example DCs, to be adjusted on the fly by the DM) are:</p>
<h2 id="destiny">Destiny</h2>
<p>How relevant your success is to Adam Kadmon's ultimate goodness. A high destiny check means the setting's contrived co-incidences go your way.</p>
<p>Destiny powers the retroactive resource rules (see: <a href="#resources">Resources</a>) and can be burned to avoid death (see: <a href="#combat">Combat</a>). It also controls circumstances that intuitively qualify as &quot;luck&quot;. Furthermore, a player may call for a convenient coincidence a number of times per session equal to their destiny dice, and then roll to see just how convenient the coincidence is.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>5: Something which by actual luck had about a 50% chance of happening</li>
<li>10: Something which by actual luck had about a 25% chance of happening</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="metaphors">Metaphors</h2>
<p>Recognizing how things are metaphors for eachother. Interacting with Yitzerah.</p>
<p>Changes made in Yetzirah do affect the physical world, but they revert as soon as current circumstances become a metaphor for something else.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>10: Identify what aspects of the current situation apply to the Vanishing Name</li>
<li>20: Exchange words telepathically</li>
<li>25: Deeper telepathy</li>
<li>25: Obtain crypric prophessies</li>
<li>25: Follow someone into Yitzerah</li>
<li>30: Letter manipulation when already in Yitzerah</li>
<li>35: Deliberately step in or out of Yitzerah</li>
<li>40: Teleportation</li>
<li>40: See clearly into the future during a solar eclipse</li>
<li>50: Letter manipulation in the material world</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exegesis">Exegesis</h2>
<p>Working with languages and texts, especially holy ones. Knowledge and comprehension of the world as it functions via sephirot. Finding relevant references in Tanakh or Talmud. Finding linguistic correspondences.</p>
<p>This skill is also used (mostly in backstory) to learn languages (see the <a href="#skills">Resources/Skills</a> section)..</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>5: Identify how interactions among sephirot correspond to lived experiences</li>
<li>10: Find the most relevant bit of Torah to a particular situation</li>
<li>15: Identify how a randomly chosen text applies to a given situation</li>
<li>15: Determine whether a linguistic correspondence is the work of mundane language evolution or reveals a hidden truth of Adam Kadmon</li>
<li>20: Trace a consonant triple through a dozen unrelated languages</li>
<li>30: Find all references to a concept in a large body of text</li>
<li>35: Deduce a Name from a passage in a holy text (add half your Naming dice to this roll, rounding down)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="social-skills">Social Skills</h2>
<p>Self explanatory.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>10: To befriend a stranger</li>
<li>15: To convince someone of something plausible (if false, subtract half their roll; if true, add half)</li>
<li>20: To make peace where there is strife</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="violence">Violence</h2>
<p>Everything from wrestling to sniping.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>10: Shoot someone with a long-barreled gun at close range</li>
<li>15: Shoot someone with a pistol at close range or long gun at moderate range</li>
<li>15: Use rapier and dagger effectively</li>
<li>25: Use a sniper rifle at multi-mile range</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>
<p>Learn and reason about Names.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>5: Look up and memorize a Name which is explicitely available to the public</li>
<li>10-15: Track down a Name which is known to the Unitarians or other underground group</li>
<li>15: Speak in a klipah you have learned but not extensively practiced</li>
<li>20: Deduce how a Name will operate with regard to edge-cases</li>
<li>20: Speak a Name at double speed</li>
<li>20: Memorize a Name by staring at it on a piece of paper for six seconds</li>
<li>25: Deduce a name from most of it, using principles of names</li>
<li>25: Crack early klipot</li>
<li>25: Memorize a Name by hearing it once.</li>
<li>25: Improvise a simple but novel klipah on the spot</li>
<li>30: Improve state-of-the-art Name-finding algorithms efficiency by 1%</li>
<li>30: Speak a Name at triple speed</li>
<li>35: Crack state-of-the-art klipot</li>
<li>35: Speak a Name at double speed in an improvised klipah</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="placebomancy">Placebomancy</h2>
<p>Perform placebomancy, or deduce how effective it will be without performing it.</p>
<p>Remember that placebomancy cannot do the physically impossible.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>10: Grant a simple blessing, allowing the recipient to reroll one die in the course of their next operation</li>
<li>15: Grant a more substantive blessing, such as +1 die to all checks of one ability thoughout the operation, or automatic successes on a more narrow category of checks.</li>
<li>15: Cause a random Motive Name to correctly open the Panama Canal using sand from the Florida Keys</li>
<li>20: Cause a random Motive Name to correctly open the Panama Canal using ordinary house keys and style</li>
<li>20: Deduce the effectiveness of a ritual without performing it</li>
<li>25: Curse someone with crippling muscle spasms using a piece of their body</li>
<li>30: Curse someone with crippling muscle spasms using a photograph of them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="science">Science</h2>
<p>The world as based on physics. Includes knowing which bits of physics are running at the moment. Also includes practical applications via technology.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>15: Repair most technological devices</li>
<li>20: (As a player) use the internet and then treat it as character knowledge</li>
<li>25: Break security (digital or physical) on a government office</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="metis">Metis</h2>
<p>Practical skills. Includes anything that doesn't fit anywhere in particular.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>10: Hold down a job</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wealth">Wealth</h2>
<p>Your ability to buy things unexpectedly. This is approximately the amount of money you have, but after earmarking some of it for rent, adding easily accessible credit, etc.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>2: Anything that IRL would be &lt;$100</li>
<li>5: &lt;$300</li>
<li>10: &lt;$1000</li>
<li>15: &lt;$3000</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="resources">Resources</h1>
<p>Resources are things your character has that are less fundamental than abilities. They come in four types: physical possessions, specific skills, names, and connections.</p>
<p>Resources can be claimed retroactively, up to the limits of chargen (dc 3×dice: unlimited; 5×dice: expensive). A resource that is clearly in line with a character concept is automatic. One which isn't requires a Destiny check, based on the probability for someone <em>of your background</em> having that resource. Once a resource is claimed retroactively, you have it permanently (unless you lose it in-universe).</p>
<p>When claiming retroactive resources, use your ability scores at time of last downtime, not your current ones (if they differ).</p>
<h2 id="physical-possessions">Physical Possessions</h2>
<p>Can be anything from clean socks to a decommissioned aircraft carrier. Possessions are generally assumed to be on your person when needed unless they are too large or there's a specific plot reason for them not to be.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>Learning a new skill is usually either a Metis or Science check, and tends to take quite a while. When making a check for which a specific skill is relevant, add two dice. Example learning DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metis 5: Jerry-rig a belay system out of rope; compose sonnets; cook arbitrary Thai curries</li>
<li>Metis 10: Work as a secretary for a large business; craft or repair clothing so that it looks “real”</li>
<li>Science 5: Identify edible plants in your native environment; Change oil in a car</li>
<li>Science 10: Write ordinary software; Understand organic chemistry</li>
<li>Exegesis 5: Know some basic vocabulary in a foreign language, enough to express simple concepts most of the time</li>
<li>Exegesis 7: Speak fluently a language which is related to your native language or which is noted for simple grammar and phonemics</li>
<li>Exegesis 10: Speak an ordinary foreign language fluently</li>
<li>Exegesis 15: Speak fluently a foreign language that is notoriously difficult to learn, such as Arabic, Cantonese or Xhosa</li>
<li>Naming 10: Practice a klipah until you can speak in it without needing a special check</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="names">Names</h2>
<p>Possessing a Name means that you can reliably remember it and speak it in one try. See the <a href="#list-of-names">List of Names</a> for DCs to learn them.</p>
<h2 id="connections">Connections</h2>
<p>Making connections is a Social Skills check. Like learning skills, this takes a while, and it is usually better to role-play explicitly outside of backstory. For backstory purposes, some example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>5: Have a casual friend who works in the health care industry</li>
<li>10: Have a casual friend at a specific hospital</li>
<li>20: Be trusted by a notorious crime boss</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="names-1">Names</h1>
<p>You can speak any name which you know. Ordinary people can speak 10 syllables a round (speaking slowly and carefully). See the <a href="#naming">Naming</a> ability for more advanced options.</p>
<p>If the name allows choices (e.g. the Kinetic name), controlling it with precision also requires a Naming check.</p>
<p>Writing a name does not activate it, but does trigger any Sentinal Names in the vicinity. Triggering a written name is easy, and destroys the name. (Destroying the name does not automatically trigger it – if you want a chain reaction of Wrathful names, you need to engineer that deliberately.)</p>
<p>Only a human can write or speak a name.</p>
<p>The Coagulant, Extinguishing, Luminous, and Thunderclap Names are available in scrollwheel form as a DC 5 Wealth check.</p>
