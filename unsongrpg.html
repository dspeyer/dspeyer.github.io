<h1 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h1>
<p>This game assumes you have read <a href="https://unsongbook.com">Unsong</a> and remember it well. If you have not, you will likely be very confused.</p>
<p>A successful game <em>should</em> include lots of specifically worked out placebomancy and yetzirah manipulation. That's what makes the setting vibrant, and will make for great stories afterwards. Therefore these things never get shoved under the abstraction threshold. But it should be possible to play a character who is better at these things than you are. Hence the entire-table-helps mechanics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a lot of more boring things <em>are</em> getting shoved under the abstraction threshold. There are explicit rules for retconning equipment precisely so that you don't have to worry about it in advance.</p>
<p>The rules are not designed to stand up to minmaxing or munchkinry. If you are inclined toward those, know that you will find no interesting challenge here and move on.</p>
<h2 id="spoiler-warning">Spoiler Warning</h2>
<p>These mechanics reveal things from Unsong which would otherwise be surprises, including one major piece of the ending.</p>
<h1 id="basic-mechanics">Basic Mechanics</h1>
<p>To see if you succeed at something, roll a number of d10s equal to your relevant ability and add the results. If any die rolls a 10 (“explodes”) reroll it and keep both values. You might add dice to the roll if you have a specific skill or helpful circumstance. If the total value on the dice meets or exceeds the DC, you succeed.</p>
<p>(If it is necessary to roll a noninteger number of dice, use d4s. They do not explode.)</p>
<p>(Do not use any dice besides d10s and d4s. Unless you have physical d22s or d72s, in which case you should find a way to incorporate them.</p>
<p>In general, DCs should look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>2: Trivial; why are you even rolling?</li>
<li>5: Ordinary people can do this, if given a few tries</li>
<li>10: If this is your thing, you should be able to do this</li>
<li>15: Requires real effort from specialists</li>
<li>20: Seriously impressive</li>
<li>30: Near the best of real-world achievement</li>
<li>40: Superhuman</li>
</ul>
<p>If it is necessary to keep track of exactly when characters do things, go into rounds. Use 10 rounds to the minute. During a round, you can move up to 20 cubits and do something.</p>
<p>There are no hit points. Injuries are described in-universe. Being shot with a gun is usually fatal.</p>
<p>If your character is about to die or otherwise suffer unacceptable harm, you may permanently burn a Destiny die to prevent it by implausible coincidence. If you have no Destiny dice, you cannot do this.</p>
<h2 id="leveling">Leveling</h2>
<p>In a multi-session campaign, characters gain dice of abilities after successful sessions. If multiple dice are gained in a session, they must be placed in separate abilities. This does not grant resources, or change the DCs at which retroactive resources can be obtained. (See <a href="#resources">Resources</a>)</p>
<p>If there is in-universe downtime, characters may acquire resources. This may either be done explicitly, with estimates of how long the acquisitions take, or abstractly, with one Starting Expensive Resource slot per week. Having downtime, even just one week of it, <em>does</em> update the DCs at which retroactive resources can be obtained.</p>
<h1 id="abilities">Abilities</h1>
<p>The abilities (and some example DCs, to be adjusted on the fly by the DM) are:</p>
<h2 id="destiny">Destiny</h2>
<p>How relevant your success is to Adam Kadmon's ultimate goodness. A high destiny check means the setting's contrived co-incidences go your way.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>10: Something which by actual luck had about a 10% chance of happening</li>
<li>20: Something which by actual luck had about a 1% chance of happening</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="metaphors">Metaphors</h2>
<p>Recognizing how things are metaphors for eachother. Interacting with Yitzerah.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>20: Exchange words telepathically</li>
<li>25: Deeper telepathy</li>
<li>25: Obtain crypric prophessies</li>
<li>30: Letter manipulation when already in Yitzerah</li>
<li>35: Deliberately step in or out of Yitzerah</li>
<li>40: Teleportation</li>
<li>40: See clearly into the future during a solar eclipse</li>
<li>50: Letter manipulation in the material world</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding">Understanding</h2>
<p>Knowledge and comprehension of the world as it functions via sephirot. Knowledge of the sephirot themselves, of sacred texts, and of languages. Finding relevant references in Tanakh or Talmud. Finding linguistic correspondences.</p>
<p>Does not include how the world functions via math: that's Science. Also does not include practical skills: those are Metis.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>10: Get the answer to a single question, moderately obscure</li>
<li>15: Get the answer to a single question, highly obscure</li>
<li>20: You (the player) can use the internet and treat it as your characters knowledge</li>
<li>30: The entire table (DM included) helps you brainstorm, and then your character thinks of it in an instant.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="social-skills">Social Skills</h2>
<p>Self explanatory.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>10: To befriend a stranger</li>
<li>15: To convince someone of something plausible (if false, subtract half their roll; if true, add half)</li>
<li>20: To make peace where there is strife</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="violence">Violence</h2>
<p>Everything from wrestling to sniping.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>10: Shoot someone with a long-barreled gun at close range</li>
<li>15: Shoot someone with a pistol at close range or long gun at moderate range</li>
<li>15: Use rapier and dagger effectively</li>
<li>25: Use a sniper rifle at multi-mile range</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>
<p>Learn and reason about Names.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>5: Look up and memorize a Name which is explicitely available to the public</li>
<li>10-15: Track down a Name which is known to the Unitarians or other underground group</li>
<li>20: Deduce how a Name will operate with regard to edge-cases</li>
<li>20: Speak a Name at double speed</li>
<li>25: Deduce a name from most of it, using principles of names</li>
<li>25: Crack early klipot</li>
<li>30: Improve state-of-the-art Name-finding algorithms efficiency by 1%</li>
<li>35: Crack state-of-the-art klipot</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="placebomancy">Placebomancy</h2>
<p>Perform placebomancy, or deduce how effective it will be without performing it.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>10: Grant a simple blessing, allowing the recipient to reroll one die in the course of their next operation</li>
<li>15: Grant a more substantive blessing, such as +1 die to all checks of one ability thoughout the operation, or automatic successes on a more narrow category of checks.</li>
<li>20: Achieve ends which would be highly impractical naturally, using a comparable degree of effort</li>
<li>20: Deduce the effectiveness of a ritual without performing it</li>
<li>25: Make up for not-quite-heroic preparation with style</li>
<li>30: (As a player) the entire table (including DM) helps you brainstorm</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="science">Science</h2>
<p>The world as based on physics. Includes knowing which bits of physics are running at the moment. Also includes practical applications via technology.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>15: Repair most technological devices</li>
<li>20: (As a player) use the internet and then treat it as character knowledge</li>
<li>25: Break security (digital or physical) on a government office</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="metis">Metis</h2>
<p>Practical skills. Includes anything that doesn't fit anywhere in particular.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>10: Hold down a job</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wealth">Wealth</h2>
<p>Buy stuff.</p>
<p>Example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>2: Anything that IRL would be &lt;$100</li>
<li>5: &lt;$300</li>
<li>10: &lt;$1000</li>
<li>15: &lt;$3000</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="resources">Resources</h1>
<p>Resources are things your character has that are less fundamental than abilities. They come in four types: physical possessions, specific skills, names, and connections.</p>
<p>Learning a new skill is usually either a Metis or Science check, and tends to take quite a while. When making a check for which a specific skill is relevant, add two dice. Example learning DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metis 5: Jerry-rig a belay system out of rope; compose sonnets; cook arbitrary Thai curries</li>
<li>Metis 10: Work as a secretary for a large business; craft or repair clothing so that it looks “real”</li>
<li>Science 5: Identify edible plants in your native environment; Change oil in a car</li>
<li>Science 10: Write ordinary software; Understand organic chemistry</li>
<li>Understanding 5: Know some basic vocabulary in a foreign language, enough to express simple concepts most of the time</li>
<li>Understanding 7: Speak fluently a language which is related to your native language or which is noted for simple grammar and phonemics</li>
<li>Understanding 10: Speak an ordinary foreign language fluently</li>
<li>Understanding 15: Speak fluently a foreign language that is notoriously difficult to learn, such as Arabic, Cantonese or Xhosa</li>
</ul>
<p>Making connections is a Social Skills check. Again, this takes a while, and it is usually better to role-play explicitly outside of backstory. For backstory purposes, some example DCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>5: Have a casual friend who works in the health care industry</li>
<li>10: Have a casual friend at a specific hospital</li>
<li>20: Be trusted by a notorious crime boss</li>
</ul>
<p>Resources can be claimed retroactively, up to the limits of chargen. A resource that is clearly in line with a character concept is automatic. One which isn't requires a Destiny check, with bonus dice for being somewhat in line. Once a resource is claimed retroactively, you have it permanently (unless you lose it in-universe).</p>
<p>When claiming retroactive resources, use your ability scores at time of last downtime, not your current ones (if they differ).</p>
<h1 id="names">Names</h1>
<h2 id="list-of-names-and-syllable-count">List of Names and Syllable Count</h2>
<p>(Taken straight from Scott's post on the subject)</p>
<p>The Abjuring Name (25): Can cancel some effects of Names of less than 25 syllables.</p>

<p>The Xenoglossal name (25): Allows one to speak certain foreign languages</p>
<h2 id="speaking-names">Speaking Names</h2>
<p>You can speak any name which you know. Ordinary people can speak 10 syllables a round (speaking slowly and carefully) but with a sufficient Naming check, you can speak at twice that speed. Speaking in a klipah requires and additional Naming check (dc 15 for a simple one, higher for more complicated) unless you've specifically practiced that particular klipah.</p>
<p>If the name allows choices (e.g. the Kinetic name), controlling it with precision also requires a Naming check.</p>
<p>Writing a name does not activate it, but does trigger any Sentinal Names in the vicinity. Triggering a written name is easy, and destroys the name. (Destroying the name does not automatically trigger it – if you want a chain reaction of Wrathful names, you need to engineer that deliberately.)</p>
<p>Only a human can write or speak a name.</p>
<h2 id="researching-names">Researching Names</h2>
<p>Some names can be discovered by diligent effort in libraries and Unitarian forums.</p>
<p>A DC 2 Naming check can find the Mortal Name.</p>
<p>A DC 5 Naming check can find any of the Ascending, Chromatic, Coagulant, Extinguishing, Luminous, or Sobering Names.</p>
<p>A DC 10 Naming check can find any of the Avalanche, Bulletproof, Fulminent, Kindling, Kinetic, Respiratory, Steelforging, Taming, Tenebrous, Thunderclap or Wakening Names.</p>
<p>A DC 15 Naming check can find any of the Abjuring, Cavernous, Enlivening, Liberating, Magnifying, Reconditioning, Sentinel, Taming, Vanishing or Volatile Names.</p>
<p>More obscure names generally require quests.</p>
<p>The Coagulant, Extinguishing, Luminous, and Thunderclap Names are available in scrollwheel form as a DC 5 Wealth check.</p>
<h1 id="character-generation">Character Generation</h1>
<p>You have one free point in each ability. You have 4 additional points to distribute among abilities as you wish.</p>
<p>You may claim unlimited resources if you could get them by rolling all 3s on your relevant acquisition check. Please keep this within reason for a character concept. Granted, “crazy hoarder” <em>is</em> a character concept. Also, remember that you can fill these in retroactively (see the Resources section).</p>
<p>You also start with four “expensive” resources, which you could get by rolling all 5s on your check. You may leave some of these blank to fill in retroactively if you wish. Mark these by checking the “SX” (Starting Expensive) box on your character sheet.</p>
<p>(There are blanks on your character sheet to mark these DCs. They are useful if you are likely to gain abilities during the game, but may not have immediate downtime.)</p>
<p>Note that languages spoken beyond your native ones count as resources. You may have multiple native languages if it fits your backstory. Do not abuse this.</p>
<p>You may be an ordained priest, which enables you to create Holy Water and grants social bonuses in relevant situations. This counts as a connection and as an expensive resource regardless of your abilities.</p>
<p>A <a href="unsong_charsheet.html">blank character sheet</a> is available.</p>
<h2 id="extra-special-abilities">Extra Special Abilities</h2>
<p>There are people in this setting with extra abilities that don't fit neatly. Starting with these means starting with fewer ability dice, and should effect your roleplay substantially.</p>
<p>For example, you can be a Fallen Angel. This has advantages: you are fluent in all languages except Aramaic; can fly when drunk on holy water; can conjure a flaming sword at will; and if killed by ordinary violence, you recorporate after a brief time. It also has disadvantages: you cannot learn Aramaic, comprehend deception, reliably remember limitations, or generally cope with the harshness of the world. You start with one fewer ability die.</p>
<p>You can also have a complicated relationship with space. Using this to your advantage requires a dc 10 Metaphors check. You start with two fewer ability dice.</p>
<p>Other abilities are possible, at similar ability-die costs.</p>
