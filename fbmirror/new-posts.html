<p>Keszthely has a variety of museums, small but clustered together:</p>
<p>The Butterfly Museum, whose actual butterflies were depressingly dead and pinned to boards, but whose fish and reptiles were impressive.</p>
<p>The Doll Museum, creepy as you might expect.</p>
<p>The Horror Museum, which freely mixed historical medieval torture and legends of Elizabeth Bathory and vampires.</p>
<p>The Historical Wax Museum, with rulers from Attila to the 1950s carefully recreated</p>
<p>The Erotic Wax Museum, mostly derived from the 17th and 18th centuries, at which I took no photos</p>
<p>The Snail Parliment, which has only one exhibit, and only needs one.</p>
<p>The Nostolgia Museum, which left me somewhat confused about what era Hungarians feel nostolgia for, and even more confused about why.</p>

<p>Lake Balaton is the largest lake in central Europe.  It's surprisingly warm and clean.  Keszthely has a sort of permanent festival on the lakeshore.  Among the offerings are boat rentals.  We tried to get far out enough to escape all city lights and look up at the stars, but the moist air over the lake turns to clouds when the sun sets.  Still pretty.</p>

<p>Let the photo deluge begin.  Starting with Keszthely, the city we were based in for a week.  Located at the west end of Lake Balaton.  Not a big city, but a pretty one, with colorful buildings, wide pedestrian plazas, a 14th century church and various attractions that will get their own posts.</p>

<p>Walking along Broadway after a week in Europe has an interesting effect.  I'm more aware of my environment.  I think our buildings can stand proud alongside those in Hungary or Vienna's modern neighborhoods (Vienna old town, maybe not).  At the same time, Broadway clearly should be pedestrianized, possibly with a tram as a mid-range, and the freed space should allow for a lot more open-air gelato stands.</p>

<p>Day 5! Festetics Palace (pronounced Fish-sticks) the Festetics were THE family of Keszthely and their home has inspired me to spray paint EVERYTHING gold when i get home. That’s equivalent to the gold gilt, ya? 😅</p>
<p>My favorite room is the library 📚 (obviously) but every room was awe-inspiring.  <br />
 Daniel got scolded for touching the bookcase door 🚪 😄  <br />
 We also got to meet a duo of black swans 🦢 and wander a fantasy garden full of cacti  🌵 and hibiscus 🌺</p>

<h6>There's an Asmodean proverb: Never publicly criticize the boss unless you're trying to take their job.</h6>
<p>There's an Asmodean proverb: Never publicly criticize the boss unless you're trying to take their job.</p>
<p>Prigozhin (head of the Wagner mercenary company) has been publicly criticizing Putin a lot.</p>
<p>Now, I realize Asmodeanism is a fictional religion written by people who are not remotely its practitioners, but I still find Prigozhin's actions make more sense through this lens.</p>
<p>Including his unforced withdrawal from Bakhmut.  Sure, it looks weak now.  But in a few monthes he'll be saying to Putin's forces, “We held the line in Bakhmut and even pushed it forward a little – you ran like dogs.  Do you really want to face me now?”.  And Putin's officers will answer “You held the line while the Ukrainians waited for equipment, not against the counter-offensive.”  But, valid or not, this will sound like an excuse.</p>
<p>Will it work?  Will Prigozhin be the next czar of Russia?  Hard to say.  On the one hand, he's managed to be visibly a contender for the post and keep breathing, which I don't think anyone else has managed.  On the other, I'm not sure anyone <em>likes</em> him, and his strategy seems optimized for things happening slowly, which may not be the case.</p>

<h6>The problem with conjunctive probabilistic reasoning is that it double-counts model uncertainty.</h6>
<p>The problem with conjunctive probabilistic reasoning is that it double-counts model uncertainty.</p>
<p>(If you fully understood that sentence, you can skip the rest of this post.)</p>
<p>For those just tuning in, conjunctive probabilistic reasoning is when something requires a series of things to happen, so you estimate p(next step | previous step) for each step and multiply.  The math suggests this should work, but in practice everything becomes less likely the more detail you think about it in.  Eliezer and Zvi have written off this entire approach as the “multi-stage fallacy” despite the fact that it ought to work.</p>
<p>One straightforward error is to ignore multiple paths to a result.  The p(I'll reach Fulton Street) isn't p(I can get on the 1 train)*p(I'll transfer successfully to the 2/3 at 72nd given I made the 1), because if the 2/3 isn't running I'll just stay on the 1 and transfer to the A/C at 59th.  But most examples of this going wrong don't fall into this category.</p>
<p>Another is to give the probability of each step, instead of the conditional.  Even though we very explicitly said to use the conditional.</p>
<p>Let's look at it another way.  To have a 50% confidence something will work (entirely reasonable) when it can be broken into a hundred tiny steps (tedious, but generally possible) means having a harmonically average confidence of 99.3% that each step will succeed given the previous.  Which is awfully confident to be of anything.</p>
<p>But <em>why</em> is that awfully confident to be of anything?  Because there's more than a 0.7% chance that the understanding you're using to estimate these probabilities was flawed to begin with.  Whenever we estimate the probability of anything, we're implicitly estimating p(that thing AND my model of the universe is good enough).  (Well, assuming p(that thing EVEN THOUGH my model isn't good enough) is negligible, which is generally the case when that thing is a plan of mine working.)</p>
<p>Call the model assumption M and the kth step succeeding Sₖ (because unicode doesn't have a subscript I) and now we can simplify:</p>
<p>𝚷 p(Sₖ|Sₖ₋₁) = 𝚷 p(M &amp; Sₖ|Sₖ₋₁) = 𝚷 p(Sₖ|Sₖ₋₁,M)p(M) = (𝚷 p(Sₖ|Sₖ₋₁,M))p(M)ⁿ</p>
<p>See that power of n at the end?  That's our problem.  Because the Ms aren't independent – they're the same event.  If you use your normal habit for estimating probabilities, you get final probabilities falling exponentially with the number of steps you consider – exactly the problem we started with.</p>
<p>Which makes the solution obvious.  Explicitly estimate all the conditional probabilities as also conditional on your world-model, and then estimate the probability of your model's adequacy and multiply it in <em>once</em>.  AFAICT, this works.  Granted, gaining calibration on estimates given model is probably a bit trickier than gaining calibration on estimates in general.</p>

<p>Reddit deleted all my subreddits and past posts.  Bizarrely, they do seem to be letting me post new things, but I can't trust that.</p>
<p>I was able to rescue the content, and I'll put some stuff various places, though of course links will die.</p>
<p>I can probably use github as a new fb rss mirror, though it won't have commenting.  I didn't get many comments on the mirror, which is why putting them into an existing stream was important.</p>
<p>I realize this last part only matters if I start posting stuff again.  I haven't in almost two months.  But I do have fifteen open LibreWriter windows with half-written drafts, so there might be a storm soon.</p>

<p>Daniel Speyer, Ann Speyer and Kenneth Speyer just  before we began our seder.  It's now 11:45 and we just finished putting everything away -- a wonderful, long, seder full of readings, some discussions and of course, traditional songs. Soup with matzah balls, poached salmon, asparagus and sweet potato kugel.  Dessert was almond cookies which Daniel and I made.  Daniel did all the chocolate dipping.  A very sweet way to end a wonderful night.</p>

<p>232 is gematria for "braid", so Elizabeth Tawanda Tubbs braided my hair in a 2-3-2 pattern.  Not sure if that comes through in the photo.  There's inherent difficulties in photographing the back of my own head.</p>
