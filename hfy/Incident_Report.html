<h1 id="tourismphotography-incident-report">[Tourism/Photography] Incident Report</h1>
<p><strong>Sargent, I need you to explain, for the record, the events of 1300 hours yesterday</strong></p>
<p>I'm not sure I can, sir. It was a complete mess.</p>
<p><strong>Just start at the beginning</strong></p>
<p>I was alerted by the automatic camera monitoring system. Outward-facing camera seven in quadrant two was pointing six degrees lower and two degrees further left than it should. I figured it was probably a mechanical failure, though I was mindful of the possibility of a Breen sneak attack. It did open a hole in our outer monitoring, albeit a small one.</p>
<p><strong>The Breen are still two days away</strong></p>
<p>I know that, sir. But it's possible they could have sent a small force of saboteurs on ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Good thinking</strong></p>
<p>So I took the elevator to the top of the wall, climbed out the access door and took a look at the camera. There was a rope wrapped around it. The rope had a hook at the end, that hooked around itself, so the rope that hung down was highly secure. There camera was bent downward as if the rope had a great weight on it. I looked down, and saw nothing. Then I looked up and saw the creature climbing the inner defenses. Did analysis figure out what it was?</p>
<p><strong>A human</strong></p>
<p>I've heard stories about humans, but I never really believed them. I guess I do now.</p>
<p>Anyway, the human must have climbed the rope, just as he was now climbing the inner defenses. His weight must have pulled the camera out of alignment. I still can't figure out how he got it there, though. Any device I know of that can do it would have been detected by the electronics scanners.</p>
<p><strong>Probably “threw” it. It's a thing humans can do. They move an object toward an objective at high velocity, let go, and let momentum take it from there. Doesn't need any technology</strong></p>
<p>Is that... possible?</p>
<p><strong>Our physicists assure me it is. I haven't wanted to check over the equations.</strong></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>He was already above my reach on the inner defenses, but he was climbing slowly. So I went back in through the access port, caught an elevator, and beat him to the next overlook.</p>
<p>While I was in the elevator, I remembered that the inner defenses are electrified. I checked my handbrain, and it reported those systems were fully online.</p>
<p>So when I got to the next access door, and looked down at the creature climbing the wall, I looked carefully. He was wearing gloves, which might have been thick enough to protect him. But his head was unprotected, and it <em>did</em> get zapped a few times. I could see and hear the sparks.</p>
<p><strong>And his reaction to fifty thousand volts of electricity?</strong></p>
<p>He said “ow”.</p>
<p>Sometimes not even that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>He made it to the top, and I was waiting for him with my weapon drawn. I demanded to know why he was climbing our fortress. He answered: “Because it's there”. I did not find this sufficient.</p>
<p>He then pulled out a camera and started photographing the surroundings. I ordered him to stop and he ignored me, so I fired on him. Standard sidearm: 1.2 megapascals of raw kinetic pressure straight into his center of mass.</p>
<p>He said “ow”.</p>
<p>He demanded to know what the big deal was, so I explained – as patiently as I could manage – that this is a fortress, and we expect to be invaded soon, and photographs of our defenses could benefit the enemy.</p>
<p>He asked if we really took this war seriously, and I assured him we did. He admitted that he didn't. But he assured me that he was not a spy, only a 'tourist' in search of the best views to photograph.</p>
<p>And then he offered me a deal: If I would pose with him for a 'selfie', he would delay publishing these photos until our war ended.</p>
<p><strong>And what did you do?</strong></p>
<p>I posed with him for a selfie.</p>
<p><strong>Good choice</strong></p>
