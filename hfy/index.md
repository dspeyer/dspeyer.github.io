# HFY Index

HFY stands for Humanity Fuck Yeah, a genre of speculative fiction in which humanity is seen through outside eyes as capable, powerful, admirable or frightening.  It was founded as a reaction to stories where humans were squishy, primitive or little more than an audience for utopian aliens.  I've found one of the best uses of the genre is to call attention to real human strengths that otherwise might go overlooked.  All these stories were originally posted on https://reddit.com/r/HFY
