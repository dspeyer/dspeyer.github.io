# [OC][Prison] What a human can do inside a prison

Author's note: I posted this as a comment in the [prison writing prompt](http://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2bjtvw/wp_writing_promptin_the_universes_most_secure/) but I think people have stopped reading that thread, so I'm giving this its own.

The human arrived in Breem'ngam jail quietly.  The police had called him "extremely dangerous", but he didn't fight or struggle.  He was downright polite to the guards who brought him in.  The jailkeepers knew he was up to something, but what?

The "new meat" fights might have given some information, but they never materialized.  He had a strange skill at evading conflict.  He spoke softly, never challenged anyone, and somehow convinced all the other prisoners that they preferred him unmangled.  Even hardened criminals want someone to care about them, and he seemed to have an unlimited font of caring.

Eventually he started up a small trade network inside the prison.  He traded in neither weapons nor drugs, but art, electronics, entertainment and services.  The electronics caught the guards attention, but none of them included power sources that could endanger the prison's security.  They considered shutting him down anyway, but he hadn't broken any actual prison rules, and on the whole the network was making their lives *easier* by preventing problems.

The guards found out what he was up to from their news feed.  He'd built a subspace transmitter, and posted to a public forum:

I cannot sit idly by on Earth and not be concerned about what happens in Breem'ngam. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.* . . .
