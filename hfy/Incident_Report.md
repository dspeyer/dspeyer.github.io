# [Tourism/Photography] Incident Report

**Sargent, I need you to explain, for the record, the events of 1300 hours yesterday**

I'm not sure I can, sir.  It was a complete mess.

**Just start at the beginning**

I was alerted by the automatic camera monitoring system.  Outward-facing camera seven in quadrant two was pointing six degrees lower and two degrees further left than it should.  I figured it was probably a mechanical failure, though I was mindful of the possibility of a Breen sneak attack.  It did open a hole in our outer monitoring, albeit a small one.

**The Breen are still two days away**

I know that, sir.  But it's possible they could have sent a small force of saboteurs on ahead.

**Good thinking**

So I took the elevator to the top of the wall, climbed out the access door and took a look at the camera.  There was a rope wrapped around it.  The rope had a hook at the end, that hooked around itself, so the rope that hung down was highly secure.  There camera was bent downward as if the rope had a great weight on it.  I looked down, and saw nothing.  Then I looked up and saw the creature climbing the inner defenses.  Did analysis figure out what it was?

**A human**

I've heard stories about humans, but I never really believed them.  I guess I do now.

Anyway, the human must have climbed the rope, just as he was now climbing the inner defenses.  His weight must have pulled the camera out of alignment.  I still can't figure out how he got it there, though.  Any device I know of that can do it would have been detected by the electronics scanners.

**Probably “threw” it.  It's a thing humans can do.  They move an object toward an objective at high velocity, let go, and let momentum take it from there.  Doesn't need any technology**

Is that... possible?

**Our physicists assure me it is.  I haven't wanted to check over the equations.**

Right.

Anyway.

He was already above my reach on the inner defenses, but he was climbing slowly.  So I went back in through the access port, caught an elevator, and beat him to the next overlook.

While I was in the elevator, I remembered that the inner defenses are electrified.  I checked my handbrain, and it reported those systems were fully online.

So when I got to the next access door, and looked down at the creature climbing the wall, I looked carefully.  He was wearing gloves, which might have been thick enough to protect him.  But his head was unprotected, and it *did* get zapped a few times.  I could see and hear the sparks.

**And his reaction to fifty thousand volts of electricity?**

He said “ow”.

Sometimes not even that.

Yeah.

Anyway.

He made it to the top, and I was waiting for him with my weapon drawn.  I demanded to know why he was climbing our fortress.  He answered: “Because it's there”.  I did not find this sufficient.

He then pulled out a camera and started photographing the surroundings.  I ordered him to stop and he ignored me, so I fired on him.  Standard sidearm: 1.2 megapascals of raw kinetic pressure straight into his center of mass.

He said “ow”.

He demanded to know what the big deal was, so I explained – as patiently as I could manage – that this is a fortress, and we expect to be invaded soon, and photographs of our defenses could benefit the enemy.

He asked if we really took this war seriously, and I assured him we did.  He admitted that he didn't.  But he assured me that he was not a spy, only a 'tourist' in search of the best views to photograph.

And then he offered me a deal: If I would pose with him for a 'selfie', he would delay publishing these photos until our war ended.

**And what did you do?**

I posed with him for a selfie.

**Good choice**
